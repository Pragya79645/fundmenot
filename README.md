# 🧃 FundMeNot: The App That Judges Your Ideas

## “Got a startup idea? Get roasted before you get funded.”

### 🧠 Inspiration

Every hackathon has that one guy pitching “Uber for Plants” or “AI that writes better AI.”
We realized what founders need isn’t funding — it’s therapy.
So we built FundMeNot — a brutal, chaotic AI panel that judges your startup idea faster than a VC ghosting your cold email.

### 💡 What It Does

You’ve got 30 seconds to pitch your “revolutionary” idea.
FundMeNot listens, analyzes, and responds — not like ChatGPT, but like a panel of unhinged investors with personality disorders.

Our AI judges don’t sugarcoat.
They roast. They question your life choices.
Sometimes they even give decent advice, but usually they just tell you to pivot into a bakery.
